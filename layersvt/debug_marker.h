/**
 * The DebugMarker class is responsible for storing and managing debug marker
 * information associated with Vulkan objects and emitting them to Perfetto traces.
 *
 * Currently, it primarily supports tracking and emitting object names.
 *
 * How it works:
 * We do not store a history of events for setting object names. Instead, we store
 * only the current name for each object (one name per object). This keeps the memory
 * footprint small for most applications (proportional to the name size multiplied by
 * the number of unique objects).
 *
 * Perfetto Session Support:
 * This solution supports:
 * - Starting a Perfetto session before the application starts.
 * - Starting a Perfetto session after the application is already running.
 * - Running multiple Perfetto sessions during a single application run.
 *
 * To support late-attach and multiple sessions, when a Perfetto session starts,
 * we write all currently known object names to the trace. We retain the names in memory
 * because a user might start another Perfetto session later, requiring us to emit
 * all object names again.
 *
 * A potential issue exists if an application constantly creates and destroys
 * objects without bound, as we currently do not remove names for destroyed objects.
 * Support for removing names on object destruction can be added later if needed.
 *
 * This class is a singleton and provides thread-safe access to its state.
